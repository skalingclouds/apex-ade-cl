# Landing.AI Optimized Configuration for Paid Plan (25 rpm)
# This configuration is optimized for processing large documents with 40-page chunks

# Number of documents to process in parallel
# Set to 1 for large documents to focus resources on single document
BATCH_SIZE=1

# Number of chunks to process in parallel per document
# With 25 rpm and ~15 sec per chunk, we can safely run 5 parallel
MAX_WORKERS=5

# Retry configuration - Let Landing.AI handle most retries
# Reduced from default 100 since we have good rate limits
MAX_RETRIES=50

# Maximum wait time for retries (seconds)
# Reduced from default 60 since we have higher rate limits
MAX_RETRY_WAIT_TIME=30

# Logging style for retries
# Options: log_msg (verbose), inline_block (progress blocks), none
RETRY_LOGGING_STYLE=inline_block

# Additional settings for optimal performance
# Vision Agent API Key (if not set in main .env)
# VISION_AGENT_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Calculate optimal parallelism:
# BATCH_SIZE × MAX_WORKERS = 1 × 5 = 5 parallel requests
# This stays well under our 25 rpm limit with room for bursts

# Performance expectations:
# - 3270 pages ÷ 40 pages/chunk = 82 chunks
# - 82 chunks ÷ 5 parallel = 17 batches
# - 17 batches × 15 sec/batch = 255 seconds = ~4.25 minutes
# - With overhead and retries: ~8-10 minutes total
