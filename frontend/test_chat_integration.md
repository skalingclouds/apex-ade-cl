# Frontend Chat Integration Test Summary

## Phase 3, Task 2: Develop Frontend Chat Component with PDF Highlight Integration

### Implementation Complete ✅

**Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced Chat Component (`Chat.tsx`)**:
   - Added `documentStatus` prop to disable chat for rejected documents
   - Added `onHighlight` callback prop to communicate highlight areas to parent
   - Chat responses with highlights now show a clickable "Show X highlighted areas" button
   - Disabled chat input with message for rejected documents
   - Successful chat responses automatically trigger highlighting

2. **Updated DocumentReview Component**:
   - Added `highlightAreas` state to track current highlights
   - Pass document status and highlight callback to Chat component
   - Added highlight overlay on PDF viewer
   - Highlights are rendered as semi-transparent yellow boxes on the PDF
   - Added highlight indicator showing count on current page
   - Added "Clear highlights" button when highlights are active

3. **PDF Highlight Overlay**:
   - Positioned absolutely over PDF page
   - Uses bbox coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) from backend
   - Scales coordinates to percentage-based positioning
   - Yellow color with 30% opacity and border
   - Non-interactive (pointer-events-none) to allow PDF interaction

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Basic Chat Flow**:
   - User can send queries and receive responses
   - Chat history is preserved and scrollable
   - Loading state shown during query processing

2. **Highlight Integration**:
   - When response includes highlights, clickable link appears
   - Clicking "Show X highlighted areas" displays highlights on PDF
   - Highlights appear on correct page with proper positioning
   - Multiple highlights can be shown simultaneously

3. **Document Status Handling**:
   - Chat is disabled for rejected documents with clear message
   - Chat is enabled for extracted and approved documents

4. **UI/UX Features**:
   - Highlight count shown on current PDF page
   - Clear highlights button to remove all highlights
   - Highlights persist when navigating between PDF pages
   - Responsive design maintains layout integrity

### Integration Points Verified:

- ✅ Chat API integration (`chatWithDocument`, `getChatHistory`)
- ✅ Real-time highlight rendering on PDF
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Document status validation
- ✅ Coordinate transformation from backend bbox to frontend positioning

### Next Steps:
- The chat interface is now fully integrated with PDF highlighting
- Users can query documents and see relevant sections highlighted
- The implementation follows the dense, utility-focused, dark mode UI style
- Ready to proceed to Phase 3, Task 3: Chat Log Storage improvements
