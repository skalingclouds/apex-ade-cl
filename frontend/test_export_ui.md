# Frontend Export Functionality Test Documentation

## Phase 4 Task 2: Frontend Export Options Implementation

### Implementation Summary

Enhanced the DocumentReview component to provide robust export functionality with:

1. **Export Buttons**: Added CSV and Markdown export buttons with:
   - Loading states during export
   - Disabled state while exporting
   - Clear visual feedback

2. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling:
   - Specific error messages from backend
   - Automatic retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts)
   - Interactive retry buttons in error toasts

3. **User Feedback**: 
   - Success toasts on successful export
   - Error toasts with retry option on failure
   - Loading indicators during export process

4. **State Management**:
   - Added `exportingCsv` and `exportingMarkdown` states
   - Buttons disable during any export operation
   - Proper state cleanup in finally blocks

### Key Changes

1. **DocumentReview.tsx**:
   ```typescript
   // Added export states
   const [exportingCsv, setExportingCsv] = useState(false)
   const [exportingMarkdown, setExportingMarkdown] = useState(false)
   
   // Enhanced export handlers with retry logic
   const handleExportCsv = async (retryCount = 0) => {
     // Retry logic up to 3 attempts
     // Interactive retry button in error toast
   }
   ```

2. **Export Buttons**:
   - Show loading spinner during export
   - Disable both buttons during any export
   - Clear labeling of export format

### Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to a document with EXTRACTED or APPROVED status
2. Click "Export CSV" button:
   - Should show loading state
   - Download CSV file on success
   - Show error with retry option on failure
3. Click "Export Markdown" button:
   - Should show loading state
   - Download Markdown file on success
   - Show error with retry option on failure
4. Test error scenarios:
   - Export document with PENDING status (should fail)
   - Disconnect network and try export (should show retry)

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Export buttons (CSV, Markdown) are visible in the review view
✅ On click, triggers download from backend endpoints
✅ If download fails, user is notified and can retry
✅ UI feedback is clear and follows style guide
✅ Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous exports
✅ Error messages are specific and helpful

### Integration with Backend

The frontend integrates with these backend endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/export/csv` - Export as CSV
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/export/markdown` - Export as Markdown

Both endpoints now include:
- Audit logging of export actions
- Status validation (only EXTRACTED/APPROVED)
- Proper error responses for invalid states
